h1. csvToLedger - Convert CSVs to Ledger

This tool allows you to convert CSVs into a format appropriate for "Ledger":https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger.  It's particularly useful when you need to specify multipart transactions.

h2. Options:

|-o "&lt;File Path&gt;", --open="&lt;File Path&gt;"|CSV file to open|
|-s "&lt;File Path&gt;", --save="&lt;File Path&gt;"|Save output to a file|
|-c "$", --currency="$"|Currency character in data|
|-d "date", --date="date"|Name of field containing transaction date|
|-n "note", --note="note"|Name of field containing transaction note|
|-a "Assets:Checking, Equity:Revenue", --accounts="Assets:Checking, Equity:Revenue"|Comma separated list of accounts|
|-f "payment, tax", --fields="payment, tax"|Comma separated list of field names (in the CSV) to include with accounts.  Fields prepended with a "-" will flip the sign of the field.|

The following examples convert CSVs generated by "TorchCL":http://torch.wbpsystems.com/cl.php ("Torch Project Management's":https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger command line utility) to ledger format.  The TorchCL commands that generated these files are:

<pre>
torchCL --list="invoices" --save="invoices.csv"
torchCL --list="payments" --save="payments.csv"
torchCL --list="expenses" --save="expenses.csv"
</pre>
