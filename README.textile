h1. csvToLedger - Convert CSVs to Ledger

This tool allows you to convert CSVs into a format appropriate for "Ledger":https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger.  It's particularly useful when you need to specify multipart transactions.

h2. Options:

|-o "&lt;File Path&gt;", --open="&lt;File Path&gt;"|CSV file to open|
|-s "&lt;File Path&gt;", --save="&lt;File Path&gt;"|Save output to a file|
|-c "$", --currency="$"|Currency character in data|
|-d "date", --date="date"|Name of field containing transaction date|
|-n "note", --note="note"|Name of field containing transaction note|
|-a "Assets:Checking, Equity:Revenue", --accounts="Assets:Checking, Equity:Revenue"|Comma separated list of accounts|
|-f "payment, tax", --fields="payment, tax"|Comma separated list of field names (in the CSV) to include with accounts.  Fields prepended with a "-" will flip the sign of the field.|

The following examples convert CSVs generated by "TorchCL":http://torch.wbpsystems.com/cl.php ("Torch Project Management's":http://torch.wbpsystems.com/ command line utility) to ledger format.  The TorchCL commands that generated these files are:

<pre>
torchCL --list="invoices" --save="invoices.csv"
torchCL --list="payments" --save="payments.csv"
torchCL --list="expenses" --save="expenses.csv"
</pre>

h2. Installing:

Installing csvToLedger is pretty easy. Because Macs and Linux already include Python, all you need to do is download the csvToLedger source, decompress it, and move it wherever you want. Of course, if you use csvToLedger a lot you might want to "add your installation location to your PATH variable":http://kb.wbpsystems.com/index.php/article/setting-your-path-variable.

On Windows, you need to download "Python 2.x":http://www.python.org/download/ and install it before installing csvToLedger.  Or install the version of csvToLedger containing Python.
